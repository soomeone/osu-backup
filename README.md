# osu-backup
Export all your osu songs with a click

This tool can be used to export all owned osu beatmaps to .osz files. With this, you can backup all your maps externally, or import them easily in the new osu!lazer. 
I personally made this programm to import all my current beatmaps to osu!lazer, so that I can test it better :)
